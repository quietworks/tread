## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Tread, please report it by emailing the maintainer directly rather than opening a public issue.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

You can expect:

- An initial response within 48 hours
- Regular updates on the progress of fixing the vulnerability
- Credit in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security issues and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
